## Description

A Intro to Programming project that takes a numerical input and translates it to roman numerals. It works for many basic cases in following the general rules, but at the time my mind for development wasn't strong enough to formulate logic to consider for every rule, as well as just not having a great grasp on the rules in the first place.
